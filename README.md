## Setup

### Dependencies

Processing pipelines are implemented in python.

#### Python 3.6+

* torch 1.1.0
* torchvision 0.2.1
* numpy 1.15.2
* pandas 1.0.3
* xgboost 0.90
* pillow 5.3.0
* scikit-learn 0.23.1
* logging 0.5.1.2
* joblib 0.15.1
* pickle 4.0

#### Requirements to run the algorithm and average test time

* 0.5118 s/patient using Nvidia GPUs (P40)
* 20.9291 s/patient using regular CPU machines

## Data

Data are in png format, and the patient info table is in csv format. Results will be saved in csv format.

### Input patient info table format

A csv file in the following formate is needed for prediction:


| patient_ID      |
| ----------------- |
| TCGA-AA-3812-01 |
| TCGA-AA-A00E-01 |
| TCGA-AA-A01Q-01 |
| TCGA-AA-A02R-01 |

If you use other kind of names, please change related codes.
There are also some cropped patches in the folder to help you go through the whole process.

### Model checkpoints

All models and feature matrix needed for processing the interpretation is stored in this fold.

* dnnPatchClser.pt
* bow.model
* palhi.model
* bow_feature.pkl
* bow_tfidftransformer.pkl

## Calculate the MSI likelihood of each patch (Step 1)

Prediction on the patch level code will make prediction on each patch. To run the code:

```
python dnn_patch_clser.py --model_folder=./models --test_data_search_path=./data --gt_table=./gt_tbl.csv --model_name=dnnPatchClser.pt --result_folder=./results
```

The `model_folder` is the folder that stores the model.

The `result_folder` is the folder that stores the results.

The `test_data_search_path` is the folder path that stores image data.

The `gt_table` is the path of patient info table and the format is shown above.

The `model_name` should be the checkpoint of the patch-level model.

A file named "pred.csv" will be saved containing the patch-level prediction results in `result_folder`. Use this file as the input of next step.

## Prediction on the patient level (Step 2)

This prediction code will predict MSI probability for each patient.

### PALHI (Step 2.1)

```
python palhi.py --model_folder=./models --llh_file=./results/pred.csv --log_file=PALHI.log --model_file=palhi.pickle.dat --result_folder=./results
```

The precess will be logged in `log_file`. The model needed is provided in this github and should be stored in the `model_folder`. A file named "PALHI_wsi_pred.csv" will be saved containing the patch-level prediction results in `result_folder`. Use this file as the input of Step3.

### bow (Step 2.2)

```
python bow.py --model_folder=./models --llh_file=./results/pred.csv --log_file=bow.log --feature_file=bow_feature.pkl --tfidftransformer_file=bow_tfidftransformer.pkl --model_file=bow.pickle.dat --result_folder=./results
```

The precess will be logged in 'log_file'. The model needed is provided in this github and should be stored in the "model_folder". A file named "BOW_wsi_pred.csv" will be saved containing the patch-level prediction results. Use this file as the input of Step3.

## Ensemble (Step 3)

```
python ensemble.py --PALHI_tbl=./results/PALHI_wsi_pred.csv --BOW_tbl=./results/BOW_wsi_pred.csv --result_folder=./results

```

The input "PALHI_tbl" and "BOW_tbl" is generated in Step1 and Step2. A file named "EPLA_output.csv" is generated as the final output saved in `result_folder`.

5 values are generated:


| Value       | Explaination               |
| ------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Sample.ID   | The input patient ID       |
| WSI.Score_x | MSI probability from PALHI |
| WSI.pred_x  | MSI status from bow        |
| WSI.Score_y | MSI probability from bow   |
| WSI.pred_y  | MSI status from bow        |
| WSI.Score   | EPLA final MSI probability |
| WSI.pred    | EPLA final MSI status      |

The threshold is 0.5 by default and can be reset using optimal threshold.
